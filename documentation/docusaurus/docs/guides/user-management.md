## User Accounts

### User Types

1. **System Administrator**
   - Full access to all features and settings
   - Can manage all users and organizations
   - Access to system-wide configurations

2. **Organization Administrator**
   - Full access within their organization
   - Can manage users, teams, and resources
   - Cannot access system settings

3. **Regular User**
   - Standard access based on roles
   - Can be assigned to teams and projects
   - Limited administrative capabilities

4. **Read-Only User**
   - View-only access to dashboards and reports
   - Cannot modify any resources
   - Ideal for stakeholders

### User Lifecycle

1. **Invitation**
   - Send email invitations with role assignments
   - Set expiration for invitations
   - Track invitation status

2. **Onboarding**
   - First-time login
   - Password setup
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enrollment

3. **Active**
   - Regular usage
   - Role and permission management
   - Activity monitoring

4. **Offboarding**
   - Account deactivation
   - Data retention and transfer
   - Access revocation

## Authentication

### Authentication Methods

1. **Email/Password**
   - Standard authentication
   - Password policies
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
   - SAML 2.0
   - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - Enterprise identity providers

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
   - SMS verification
   - Hardware security keys
   - Biometric authentication

### Session Management

- **Session Duration**: Configurable timeout (default: 24 hours)
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limit simultaneous logins
- **Session Termination**: Manual and automatic options
- **Device Management**: View and revoke active sessions

## Roles & Permissions

### Built-in Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to all features and settings |
| **Editor** | Create and edit dashboards and reports |
| **Viewer** | View dashboards and reports |
| **Data Analyst** | Advanced query and analysis capabilities |
| **Data Engineer** | Manage data sources and ETL pipelines |

### Custom Roles

1. **Create Custom Role**
   - Define role name and description
   - Select base permissions
   - Set resource access levels

2. **Permission Granularity**
   - Dashboard-level permissions
   - Data source access
   - Team management
   - User administration

3. **Permission Inheritance**
   - Role-based inheritance
   - Team-based permissions
   - Resource-specific overrides

## Teams & Groups

### Team Structure

1. **Create Teams**
   - Department-based (Marketing, Sales, etc.)
   - Project-based
   - Cross-functional teams

2. **Team Management**
   - Add/remove members
   - Set team administrators
   - Configure team settings

3. **Nested Teams**
   - Hierarchical team structure
   - Inherited permissions
   - Cross-team collaboration

### Access Control

1. **Resource Sharing**
   - Share dashboards with teams
   - Set view/edit permissions
   - Time-based access

2. **Row-Level Security**
   - Data filtering by user attributes
   - Dynamic data masking
   - Column-level security

## SSO & Identity Providers

### Supported Providers

- **Enterprise**: Active Directory, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin
- **Cloud**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365
- **Social**: Google, GitHub, LinkedIn
- **Custom**: Any SAML 2.0 or OIDC provider

### Configuration

1. **SAML Configuration**
   - Upload metadata XML
   - Configure entity ID and endpoints
   - Set up attribute mapping

2. **OIDC Configuration**
   - Client ID and secret
   - Authorization and token endpoints
   - User profile mapping

3. **Just-in-Time Provisioning**
   - Automatic user creation
   - Role assignment rules
   - Team membership mapping

## Audit Logs

### Log Categories

1. **Authentication**
   - Login attempts
   - Password changes
   - MFA events

2. **User Management**
   - User creation/modification
   - Role changes
   - Permission updates

3. **Data Access**
   - Query execution
   - Data exports
   - Dashboard views

### Monitoring & Alerts

- Suspicious activity detection
- Failed login attempts
- Permission changes
- Data access patterns

## Security Policies

### Password Policies

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Complexity requirements
- Password history
- Expiration period
- Account lockout

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data residency options
- Backup and recovery
- Data retention policies

### Compliance

- GDPR compliance
- HIPAA compliance
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- Regular security audits

## Best Practices

### User Management

1. **Provisioning**
   - Use Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning
   - Implement approval workflows
   - Regular access reviews

2. **Role Design**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Create role templates
   - Document permission sets

3. **Offboarding**
   - Automated deprovisioning
   - Data ownership transfer
   - Access revocation

### Security

1. **Authentication**
   - Enforce MFA for all users
   - Implement passwordless authentication
   - Regular security training

2. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time alerting
   - Regular access reviews
   - Anomaly detection

3. **Compliance**
   - Regular security assessments
   - Documentation and evidence collection
   - Third-party audits

### Performance

1. **Optimization**
   - Role caching
   - Permission evaluation optimization
   - Batch operations for bulk changes

2. **Scalability**
   - Distributed permission evaluation
   - Sharded user directories
   - Caching strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Access Denied**
   - Verify user roles and permissions
   - Check team memberships
   - Review permission inheritance

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check SSO configuration
   - Verify user status in identity provider
   - Review audit logs

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check for permission bloat
   - Review complex permission rules
   - Monitor system resources
