# Multi-Frontend Docker Build Setup - Complete

## Overview
Your SaaS multi-frontend project is now configured with a production-ready Docker setup using the **Hybrid Builder + Per-App Runtime** strategy.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Version Control (`.nvmrc`)
- Locks Node.js version to `20.12.2` (matches Docker base image)
- Ensures consistency across development, CI, and production environments

### 2. CI/CD Configuration (`.compose.ci.yaml`)
- Specialized compose file for CI/CD pipelines
- Optimized for build caching and parallel execution
- Read-only volumes for security in CI environments

### 3. Enhanced Makefile
- **New targets added:**
  - `make ci` - Full CI pipeline (build + test)
  - `make smoke` - Local smoke test (build everything + run tests)
  - `make build-fast` - Build with BuildKit for faster performance
  - `make clean-deep` - Deep cleanup of all caches and volumes
  - `make setup-node` - Setup Node.js environment with corepack

### 4. Improved Dockerfile
- Added `curl` for health checks
- Enabled `corepack` for package manager consistency
- Optimized layer caching

### 5. Enhanced .dockerignore
- Added patterns for build artifacts (`**/dist`, `**/.next`, `**/.output`)
- Excluded development test files and temporary artifacts
- Added TypeScript build info exclusion

### 6. GitHub Actions CI/CD (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Automated build and test pipeline
- Docker layer caching for faster builds
- Security scanning with npm audit
- Staging and production deployment hooks

## Usage Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start all development services
make dev

# Start individual services
make dev-web          # Web root only
make dev-dashboard    # Dashboard only
make dev-cliente360   # Cliente360 only
make dev-schedule     # Schedule Manager only

# Check service status
make status
make health
```

### Building & Testing
```bash
# Build all production assets
make build

# Run all tests (unit + e2e)
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit        # Unit tests only
make test-e2e         # E2E tests only

# Local smoke test (build + test everything)
make smoke

# CI pipeline (exactly what runs in GitHub Actions)
make ci
```

### Performance & Optimization
```bash
# Fast build with BuildKit
make build-fast

# Setup local Node.js environment
make setup-node

# Deep cleanup when things get weird
make clean-deep
```

## Service Architecture

### Development Services (Port Mapping)
- **Web Root:** http://localhost:5173
- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:5174  
- **Cliente360:** http://localhost:5175
- **Schedule Manager:** http://localhost:5176
- **Documentation:** http://localhost:3000
- **API Backend:** http://localhost:8000

### Build Services
Each frontend app has its own build service:
- `web-root-build`
- `dashboard-page-build`
- `cliente360-page-build`  
- `schedule-manager-build`

### Test Services
- `test-runner` - Vitest unit tests
- `e2e-runner` - Playwright end-to-end tests

## Docker Profiles

### `dev` Profile
- All development services with hot reload
- Volume mounts for live development
- Health checks enabled

### `build` Profile  
- Production build services only
- Outputs static assets to `dist/` directories
- Optimized for CI/CD pipelines

### `test` Profile
- Unit and E2E test runners
- Depends on built applications
- Generates test reports and coverage

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The pipeline automatically:
1. **Build Phase:** Creates optimized Docker images with layer caching
2. **Test Phase:** Runs unit tests and E2E tests in parallel
3. **Security Phase:** Runs npm audit for vulnerability scanning
4. **Deploy Phase:** Auto-deploys to staging (develop branch) or production (main branch)

### Local CI Simulation
```bash
# Run exactly what CI runs
make ci

# Test CI file locally
docker compose -f .compose.ci.yaml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Error Prevention Checklist

### âœ… Build-time Protections
- [x] Node version pinned with `.nvmrc`
- [x] Exact dependency locking with `npm ci --frozen-lockfile`
- [x] Comprehensive `.dockerignore` prevents cache pollution
- [x] Multi-stage builds for clean separation
- [x] BuildKit enabled for optimal caching

### âœ… Runtime Protections  
- [x] Health checks on all services
- [x] Read-only volumes in CI environment
- [x] Proper volume isolation between services
- [x] Environment variable validation

### âœ… Development Experience
- [x] Hot reload working in all dev services
- [x] Individual service control with make targets
- [x] Comprehensive logging and status monitoring
- [x] Fast cleanup and reset capabilities

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Ensure Node.js environment
make setup-node

# 2. Start development
make dev

# 3. Run tests
make test

# 4. Build for production  
make build

# 5. Run full CI pipeline
make ci
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Build suddenly fails in CI"
```bash
# Reset everything and try again
make clean-deep
make ci
```

### "Hot reload not working"
```bash
# Restart dev services
make restart-dev
```

### "Out of disk space"
```bash
# Clean up unused Docker resources
make clean-deep
```

### "Tests failing randomly"
```bash
# Check service health first
make health

# Run tests in isolation
make test-unit
make test-e2e
```

## What's Next?

1. **Add more apps:** Copy the pattern in `docker-compose.yml` for new services
2. **Production deployment:** Customize the GitHub Actions deploy steps
3. **Monitoring:** Add logging aggregation and metrics collection
4. **Performance:** Add CDN integration for static asset delivery

Your multi-frontend Docker setup is now production-ready with best practices for caching, testing, and deployment! ðŸš€
