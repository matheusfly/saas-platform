## Project Overview

This project contains multiple Textual TUI applications that demonstrate various aspects of Terminal User Interface development with the Textual framework. The applications range from simple examples to more complex demonstrations of advanced features.

## Demo Application

### Location
`textual_demo_app/demo_app.py`

### Features
- **Complex Layout Management**: Uses CSS Grid for responsive layout design
- **Interactive Components**: Buttons, progress bars, and live output display
- **Reactive Programming**: Automatic UI updates through reactive attributes
- **Background Task Execution**: Simulated long-running processes with progress tracking
- **Live Terminal Output**: Real-time logging with RichLog widget
- **Dynamic Styling**: Theme management and dynamic CSS class manipulation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Custom key bindings for app actions

### Key Components
- `DemoApp`: Main application class with comprehensive functionality
- `RichLog`: Advanced text display with rich formatting
- `ProgressBar`: Visual progress indicator
- `Button`: Interactive buttons with different variants
- `Static`: Static text content display
- `Container` and `VerticalScroll`: Layout containers

### CSS Styling
- Inline CSS with custom variables for consistent theming
- Grid-based layout with responsive design
- Nested selectors for component-specific styling
- Dynamic classes for state-based appearance changes

## Stopwatch Application

### Location
`textual_tui_app/app.py`

### Features
- **Multiple Stopwatches**: Manage several independent stopwatches
- **Dynamic Widget Management**: Add/remove stopwatches at runtime
- **Precise Time Tracking**: High-precision timing using monotonic clock
- **State Management**: Visual state changes with CSS classes
- **External CSS**: Styling through separate CSS file
- **Keyboard Controls**: Shortcuts for app actions

### Key Components
- `TimeDisplay`: Custom widget for elapsed time display
- `Stopwatch`: Composite widget combining buttons and time display
- `StopwatchApp`: Main application with dynamic stopwatch management
- `HorizontalGroup`: Layout container for stopwatch components
- `Digits`: Widget for numeric display

### CSS Styling
- External CSS file (`textual_tui_app/app.tcss`)
- State-based styling with `.started` class
- Docking system for button positioning
- Theme-aware color variables

## Test Applications

### Minimal Test App
`textual_tui_app/test_footer.py`
- Demonstrates basic app structure with Header and Footer
- Simple dark mode toggle functionality

### Basic Test App
`textual_demo_app/test_app.py`
- Shows fundamental components: Button, TextLog, ProgressBar
- Simple event handling and output logging

## Documentation

### Comprehensive Guides
1. **README.md**: Overview documentation for the demo application
2. **TUI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**: Complete guide to Textual TUI development
3. **COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md**: Detailed reference for Textual components
4. **METHOD_GUIDES.md**: Implementation patterns and best practices

### Documentation Features
- Detailed explanations of Textual concepts
- Code examples for common patterns
- Best practices for TUI development
- Component-specific usage instructions
- Method implementation guides

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Keyboard bindings for user actions

### Layout Management
- CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Container widgets for organization
- Responsive design principles
- Nested layouts with context managers

### State Management
- Reactive attributes for automatic UI updates
- Computed properties based on reactive values
- CSS class manipulation for visual states
- Event-driven state changes

### User Interaction
- Button handling and variants
- Keyboard shortcuts and bindings
- Mouse event handling
- Real-time feedback mechanisms

### Advanced Features
- Background task execution with `@work` decorator
- Thread-safe UI updates with `call_from_thread`
- Dynamic widget creation and removal
- Custom widget development

### Styling
- CSS-like styling system
- Theme variables for consistent design
- Selector specificity and nesting
- Dynamic styling based on state

## Running the Applications

### Demo Application
```bash
python textual_demo_app/demo_app.py
```

Key interactions:
- `d`: Toggle dark mode
- `s`: Toggle sidebar visibility
- `c`: Change grid cell colors
- `r`: Run simulated process
- Buttons: Click to trigger actions

### Stopwatch Application
```bash
python textual_tui_app/app.py
```

Key interactions:
- `d`: Toggle dark mode
- `a`: Add new stopwatch
- `r`: Remove last stopwatch
- Buttons: Start, Stop, Reset individual stopwatches

### Test Applications
```bash
python textual_tui_app/test_footer.py
python textual_demo_app/test_app.py
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with test applications** to understand basic concepts
2. **Explore the stopwatch app** for intermediate features
