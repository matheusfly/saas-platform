# FUTURE WORK: Docker Compose CI Workflow
# This is a proof-of-concept CI workflow that demonstrates how to use
# docker compose --profile test up to run unit and e2e tests in CI.
#
# TODO: This workflow is currently a stub and needs to be fully implemented
# when the Docker Compose test profile and test services are ready.

          # FUTURE WORK: This command will run unit and e2e tests
          # using the test profile defined in docker-compose.yml
          docker compose --profile test up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test-runner
          
          # Alternative approach if test services need to be run separately:
          # docker compose --profile test up -d
          # docker compose exec test-runner npm run test:unit
          # docker compose exec test-runner npm run test:e2e
          # docker compose down
      
      # FUTURE WORK: Add test result collection and reporting
      # - name: Collect test results
      #   if: always()
      #   run: |
      #     docker compose cp test-runner:/app/test-results ./test-results
      #     docker compose cp test-runner:/app/coverage ./coverage
      
      # - name: Upload test results

      #     files: ./coverage/lcov.info
      
      - name: Clean up
        if: always()
        run: |
          docker compose --profile test down -v
          docker system prune -f

# FUTURE WORK: Additional considerations for implementation:
# 1. Define test profile in docker-compose.yml with test services
# 2. Create test-runner service that executes unit and e2e tests
# 3. Configure test databases and dependencies in the test profile
# 4. Add proper error handling and test result reporting
# 5. Consider adding matrix builds for different environments
# 6. Add integration with code coverage tools
# 7. Configure notifications for test failures
