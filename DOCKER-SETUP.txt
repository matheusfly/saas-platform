📋 DOCKER STAGES:
1. deps  - FROM node:20-alpine, npm ci dependencies
2. dev   - Copy source, configurable CMD via build-arg  
3. prod  - npm run build, expose /dist volume

🚀 TO GET STARTED:

1. Start Docker Desktop (if not running):
   - Open Docker Desktop application
   - Wait for it to fully start

2. Load PowerShell functions:
   . .\docker-scripts.ps1

3. Build all stages:
   Build-All

4. Start development:
   Start-Dev
   # Available at http://localhost:5173

5. Or use Docker Compose directly:
   docker-compose up dev

📁 KEY FEATURES:
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Layer caching for faster rebuilds  
- Hot reload for development
- Test runners (unit & E2E)
- Production build extraction
- Comprehensive .dockerignore
- PowerShell management scripts

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
- Start Docker Desktop
- Test the build: Build-All
- Run development: Start-Dev
- Run tests: Run-Tests
- Build production: Export-Build
