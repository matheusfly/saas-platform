# Customer 360 - UI/UX Revamp Proposal (v2)

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Clarity & Intuitiveness**: Simplify the layout to make data more accessible and insights easier to understand.
*   **Action-Oriented Design**: Enable users to not just view data, but also to act on it directly from the dashboard.
*   **Scalability**: Introduce a modular component system that can be easily extended with new features.

## 2. High-Level Changes

*   **Unified Dashboard**: Combine the `Dashboard` and `DataUpload` sections into a single, tabbed interface to streamline the user experience.
*   **Interactive KPI Cards**: Make the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards clickable, allowing users to drill down into detailed reports.
*   **Enhanced Customer Table**: Add advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination to the customer table for better data exploration.
*   **Global Search**: Implement a persistent search bar in the sidebar to allow users to quickly find customers from anywhere in the application.

## 3. New Component Structure

### `App.tsx`
*   **Layout**: A two-column layout with a persistent `Sidebar` and a main content area.
*   **Routing**: Introduce a simple routing system to handle different views (e.g., Dashboard, Settings).

```typescript
// src/App.tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import Sidebar from './components/Sidebar';
import DashboardPage from './pages/DashboardPage';
import SettingsPage from './pages/SettingsPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="flex bg-gray-100 min-h-screen">
        <Sidebar />
        <main className="flex-1 p-8">
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<DashboardPage />} />
            <Route path="/settings" element={<SettingsPage />} />
          </Routes>
        </main>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### `pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
*   **Tabs**: A tabbed interface with two main sections: "Dashboard" and "Data Management".
*   **Dashboard Tab**: Contains the KPI cards and the enhanced customer table.
*   **Data Management Tab**: Includes the `DataUpload` component and a new section for viewing data processing history.

### `components/Sidebar.tsx`
*   **Navigation**: Links to the "Dashboard" and "Settings" pages.
*   **Global Search**: A new search input that allows users to search for customers from any view.

### `components/KpiCard.tsx`
*   **Interactivity**: The card will be a clickable element that navigates to a detailed report view.
*   **Visual Polish**: Add subtle hover effects and a more modern design.

### `components/CustomerTable.tsx`
*   **Controls**: Add controls for filtering by status (e.g., "Active", "At Risk"), sorting by columns, and paginating through results.
*   **Actions**: Include action buttons for each customer (e.g., "View Details", "Send Email").

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Feedback**: Gather feedback on this proposal.
2.  **Implementation**: Create the new components and pages as outlined above.
3.  **Styling**: Apply the new visual design using Tailwind CSS.
