# Backend Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the work done to create a unified backend for the `bi_dash` application. The backend is built with Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, and it provides a solid foundation for the continued development of the `bi_dash` application.

## Evolution of the Backend

The backend was developed in a series of steps, as outlined in the `INTEGRATED_CODEBASE_PLAN.md` file. The following is a summary of the work done in each step:

1.  **Set up the backend directory structure**: The first step was to create the directory structure for the backend, as outlined in the `INTEGRATED_CODEBASE_PLAN.md` file. This included creating separate directories for API routes, core configurations, data models, Pydantic schemas, database connection, and CRUD operations.

2.  **Create `backend/requirements.txt`**: The next step was to create the `requirements.txt` file with the specified dependencies. This file lists all the Python packages that are required to run the backend.

3.  **Implement the database configuration**: The third step was to implement the database configuration in the `backend/app/core/database.py` file. This file sets up the SQLAlchemy engine, session management, and base model class.

4.  **Define the SQLAlchemy data models**: The fourth step was to define the SQLAlchemy data models in the `backend/app/models/` directory. These models define the structure of the database tables.

5.  **Create Pydantic schemas**: The fifth step was to create the Pydantic schemas in the `backend/app/schemas/` directory. These schemas are used for data validation and serialization.

6.  **Implement the CRUD operations**: The sixth step was to implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the `backend/app/crud/` directory. These functions are used to interact with the database.

7.  **Create the API endpoints**: The seventh step was to create the API endpoints in the `backend/app/api/` directory. These endpoints expose the data to the frontend.

8.  **Set up database migrations**: The eighth step was to set up database migrations using Alembic. This will make it easy to manage the database schema as the application evolves.

9.  **Integrate the frontend with the new backend APIs**: The ninth step was to integrate the `customer_360` and `controle_ponto` frontend applications with the new backend API. These applications now fetch data from the new backend instead of using mock data or static JSON files.

10. **Implement visual schema documentation**: The tenth step was to implement visual schema documentation. This was done by generating a JSON schema from the Pydantic models.

11. **Add comprehensive testing**: The eleventh step was to add comprehensive testing. This was done by creating a suite of tests for the API endpoints.

12. **Containerize the application**: The twelfth step was to containerize the application using Docker. This will make it easy to deploy and run the application in a production environment.

## Criticism

The development process was not without its challenges. The following are some of the issues that were encountered:

*   **Python path issues**: I encountered several issues with the Python path, which made it difficult to run the tests. This was eventually resolved by creating a `conftest.py` file and adding the `backend` directory to the Python path.
*   **Dependency issues**: I encountered several dependency issues, which were caused by the `sqlalchemy-dbml` and `eralchemy` packages. These issues were resolved by removing the problematic packages and finding alternative ways to generate the schema documentation.

## Future Work

The following are some of the things that could be done to improve the backend:

*   **Add more tests**: The current test suite only covers the customer endpoints. More tests should be added to cover the other endpoints.
*   **Add authentication**: The backend does not currently have any authentication. This should be added to protect the data.
*   **Add logging**: The backend does not currently have any logging. This should be added to make it easier to debug issues.
*   **Add CI/CD**: A CI/CD pipeline should be set up to automate the testing and deployment of the backend.
