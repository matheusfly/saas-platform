Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! This document outlines the process for contributing to the codebase.

## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Git
- (Recommended) VS Code with recommended extensions

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/saas-platform.git
   cd saas-platform
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update the .env file with your configuration
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use the following prefix for your branches:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test-related changes

Example: `feature/add-user-authentication`

### Code Style

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

- Add password reset form
- Implement API integration
- Add success/error handling

Closes #123
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
npm test:unit

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
